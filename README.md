Horse simulation created with the Godot game engine

Currently horse and wolf follow the mouse. When the horse sees the wolf it turns away from it. When the wolf sees the horse it follows it. When the wolf gets the horse, the horse is reborn at a random place on the screen. 
Both crash into the walls.
