Horse simulation created with the Godot game engine

Currently the horses and wolves follow the mouse. When the horses see a wolf they turn away from it. When a wolf sees a horse it follows it. When the wolf gets the horse, the horse is reborn at a random place on the screen. 
All crash into the walls.

###Requirements###
Needs PythonScript installed in Godot inside the project (the pythonscript files will be saved inside the working directory - I did not include them in the git, because they get quite large). With numpy and scikit-learn installed via pip in the Godot Python directory.
